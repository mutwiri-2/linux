There are many linux distributions (OS that use Linux (the linux kernel)) to choose from. The most
popular are:

1. ### Debian - [link to debian](https://www.debian.org/)

- 3 versions you can choose use, Stable, Testing and Unstable. Stable is an overall good branch to be on. Testing and Unstable are rolling releases. This means that any incremental changes in those branches will eventually become Stable
- uses Debian package management tools (.dpkg) to install and manages packages

2. ### Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) - [link to RHEL](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux/)

# Introduction to Linux

### Definition and History

**What is linux**: Linux is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds

A linux system is divided into 3 parts:
* Hardware (h/w) - memory, CPUs, Harddisks (HDD), keyboard e.t.c
* Linux Kernel - Core of the Operating system. It manages h/w and tells it how to interact with the system
* User space - This is where users interact with the system (shell)

The kernel control pretty much everything that happens in a linux system as it allows h/w (hardware) to talk to s/w (software)

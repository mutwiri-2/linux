**The Shell** - a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and sends them to the operating system to perform

Almost all Linux distributions will default to the bash (Bourne Again Shell) shell. There are other shells available such as ksh (korn shell), zsh (Z shell), tsch(tee-see shell)

Different shells will have different prompts, in our case the $ is for a normal user using Bash, Bourne or Korn shell, you don't add the prompt symbol when you type the command, just know that it's there

### Commands

- `echo` - prints out the text arguments to the display e.g `echo Hello World` will print Hello World to the display
